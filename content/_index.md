I am Tianqi Xu, a Computer Science PhD student at KAUST. I enjoy programming and reading stories. Currently, I am also an intern at [Eigent.ai](https://www.eigent.ai/), working on Language Model Agents.

My research interests include Language Model Agents and general Deep Learning. I define myself as a research engineer by exploring what really matters and building what people need.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained a BEng degree from SUSTech and an MS degree from KAUST, both in computer science.
